      Number using O6 output only:             136
      Number using O5 output only:              28
      Number using O5 and O6:                    6
    Number used as exclusive route-thru:         1
  Number of route-thrus:                        29

Slice Logic Distribution:
  Number of occupied Slices:                    72 out of   7,200    1%
  Number of LUT Flip Flop pairs used:          178
    Number with an unused Flip Flop:            77 out of     178   43%
    Number with an unused LUT:                   7 out of     178    3%
    Number of fully used LUT-FF pairs:          94 out of     178   52%
    Number of unique control sets:               7
    Number of slice register sites lost
      to control set restrictions:              11 out of  28,800    1%

  A LUT Flip Flop pair for this architecture represents one LUT paired with
  one Flip Flop within a slice.  A control set is a unique combination of
  clock, reset, set, and enable signals for a registered element.
  The Slice Logic Distribution report is not meaningful if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-slice resource or if Placement fails.
  OVERMAPPING of BRAM resources should be ignored if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-BRAM resource or if placement fails.

IO Utilization:
  Number of bonded IOBs:                       150 out of     480   31%

    Number used as BUFGs:                        1

Average Fanout of Non-Clock Nets:                2.73
